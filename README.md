<h1>Stormworks Modded Builder Pallettes</h1>
Tooling to help reduce cluttering of the build menu in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_and_Rescue/">Stormworks</a> editor. This tool has been created for mod users, but is not limited to them.

<h2>Setup</h2>
To set-up, download the tool from releases and run the .exe. Provide the stormworks install that you want to work with. Then decide whether or not you want to import the pallettes default setup.

<h2>Use</h2>
Hide/unhide the pallette of your choosing and reload your save file in-game (you may save, then reload if preffered). Now if you access your editor, any blocks that are hidden in all categories will not show up in editor, but still exist and work as they should on your builds.

<h2>Creating your own categories/ Pallettes</h2>
You can copy any .xml in the categories folder (program > open category folder) and set your own category. You'll be able to sort <b>Explicitly</b>(by specified file name, mind to include .xml at the end), <b>by Prefix</b>, and <b>by Contents of the file name</b>
if you've made a mod and want to include a pallette file for your mod users, you can zip your mod's pallettes together with your mod file, and it should work for your users. Please include an author name when you distribute your pallettes.
